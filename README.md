## Depth Estimation Based on Pre-trained Models for SLAM robot, Leader 2023.02-2023.04
# Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Prof. Even Peng
* Task: Use one camera to build an end to end system to better do depth estimation
* Use simple U-Net to do first experiment
* Use large pretrained feature extinction model to replace encoder part of U-Net and pretrained large up sampling 
model to enhance decoder part of U-Net. Do experiment on SLAM robort.
